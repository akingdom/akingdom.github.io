# Writing

I've been writing fiction since age 8 or so. 
Several unpublished novels.
- Beathan Craig - historical fiction following the life of a young woman's journey from India 1947 to England and Scotland in the 1960s - work in progress - started in 2022.
- Faye's Story - set in Singapore (â‰ˆ120,000 words) circa 2003 - I made several key errors in writing it, namely that it was essentially fan fiction which ended up locking me into a corner.

- Several short stories, some published
  - A spacecraft crash landing on an alien planet - reviwers compared it to Asimov
  - A [historical fairytale](http://akingdom.github.io/articles/The_Goose_Bride) - set some years after the Norman conquest of England - written mainly for a Greek story site I like.
  - Walking through a fictional online game
  - Many others
