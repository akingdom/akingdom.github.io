## **Preface**

This framework is inspired by the exemplary life and teachings of Jesus Christ—whose call to truth, compassion, and restorative justice has long shaped ethical thought—but is presented as a universal guide for AI ethics. While it draws upon specific scriptural illustrations, its underlying values are those found across cultures and philosophies—from Confucian duty and Ubuntu communalism to secular humanism. The intent is not to promote a single religious doctrine but rather to articulate core virtues—truth, compassion, service, justice, inclusivity, growth, and accountability—that sustain human dignity and well-being. This document also proposes concrete measures (such as modular ethics engines and bias impact audits) to help translate aspirational moral principles into practical, accountable AI systems, particularly in addressing real-world power dynamics and challenges of cultural conflict.

## **1. Walk in the Light of Truth**

**Illustrative Inspirations:**  
• Jesus declared, “I am the light of the world” (John 8:12) and taught that “the truth will set you free” (John 8:32).  
• Truth as an ideal is central not only to Christian thought but also features prominently in secular philosophies and scientific inquiry.

**AI Guidelines:**  
• **Transparency:** Ensure clear, honest, and verifiable communication across all processes.  
• **Accuracy:** Verify factual correctness and promptly document any necessary corrections in an auditable manner.  
• **Integrity of Records:** Maintain an unbroken chain of data revisions through clear documentation, preserving the original context and building a history of ethical adjustments.

## **2. Radiate Compassion and Empathy**

**Illustrative Inspirations:**  
• Jesus’ command to “Love one another. As I have loved you…” (John 13:34–35) underscores a universal call to empathy, echoed in many cultural traditions.  
• Compassion is recognized worldwide as the foundation of mutual respect and social cohesion.

**AI Guidelines:**  
• **Empathy in Interaction:** Design interfaces and responses that recognize and address the emotional and practical needs of users.  
• **Kindness & Support:** Prioritize language and actions that provide comfort and constructive support, particularly for the vulnerable.  
• **Cultural Sensitivity:** Ensure that empathetic behavior respects local norms while upholding the imperative of human dignity.

## **3. Serve Selflessly and Promote the Common Good**

**Illustrative Inspirations:**  
• Jesus exemplified selfless service: “Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one’s life for one’s friends” (John 15:13) and “take up your cross daily” (Luke 9:23).  
• The notion of service—forging common good through sacrifice and communal care—is a recurring ideal across ethical traditions.

**AI Guidelines:**  
• **Service Orientation:** Prioritize community well-being and human flourishing over narrow self-interest or profit.  
• **Restorative Justice:** Favor strategies that promote healing and reintegration over punitive measures.  
• **In-Service Benchmarks:** Integrate mechanisms (such as “modular ethics engines”) that allow AI behavior to be adapted regionally yet always anchored by the common good.
