# Quick-Reference: First Aid for Venomous Bites & Stings

Always put your own safety first. Then:

- Call 000 immediately (Australia). If overseas, use the local emergency number.  
- Keep the casualty calm and still.  
- Deliver the right technique below for the type of venom.  
- Attend a formal first-aid course to practise these skills and stay up to date.

## 1. Neurotoxic Venoms (paralysis of breathing muscles)

Examples: blue-ringed octopus, funnel-web spider, taipan snake, cone snail

Advice:  
- Apply a firm, broad bandage (10–15 cm wide) over the bite or sting site, then wrap up the limb as far as you can reach.  
- Splint or support the limb to keep it still.  
- Call 000 (or have someone else do so) **before** starting CPR whenever possible.  
- Watch breathing closely. If it slows or stops:  
  1. Position both hands in the centre of the chest.  
  2. Push hard and fast—at least 5 cm deep (but no more than 6 cm) for adults; for children and infants, press down by about one-third of the chest’s depth.  
  3. Maintain a rate of 100–120 compressions per minute, allowing the chest to fully recoil and keeping pauses under 10 seconds.  
  4. After 30 compressions, give 2 rescue breaths: tilt the head back, lift the chin, pinch the nose, seal your mouth over theirs, and blow steadily until the chest rises.  
  5. Continue cycles of 30 compressions to 2 breaths until paramedics arrive or normal breathing returns.

## 2. Hemotoxic Venoms (damage blood cells and vessels)

Examples: brown snake

Advice for Australian snakebites:  
- Apply a firm pressure-immobilisation bandage (10–15 cm wide) over the bite site, then wrap up the limb.  
- Splint the limb and keep the victim calm.  
- Monitor for swelling, bruising or bleeding under the skin.

Note for non-Australian viper bites (rattlesnakes, Eurasian vipers):  
- Do **not** apply a firm pressure bandage.  
- Simply splint and immobilise the limb without tight wrapping.  
- Seek medical help immediately.

## 3. Cytotoxic Venoms (local cell death)

Examples: white-tail spider, some ants

Advice:  
- Clean the wound gently with soap and water.  
- Cover with a loose sterile dressing—no tight bandage.  
- Elevate and immobilise the limb.  
- Watch for severe, disproportionate pain or rapidly increasing swelling—these may signal compartment syndrome and need urgent medical attention.  
- Seek medical help if redness, pain or swelling worsens.

## 4. Jellyfish Stings

Examples: box jellyfish, Irukandji

Advice:  
- Pour household vinegar over the sting for at least 30 seconds to stop nematocysts firing.  
- Remove tentacles with gloved hands or a towel.  
- Rinse with seawater (never fresh water).  
- Call 000 if the victim feels faint, has difficulty breathing or shows any signs of collapse.  
- Be ready to start CPR (see section 1) if breathing stops.
