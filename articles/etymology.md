## Etymology

- **Etymology** is the study of the origin and history of words and their meanings. This word relates to the Ancient Greek words ἐτεός (*eteós*, in the sense of true, stable, real) and λογία (*logía*, in the sense of a descriptive account, a story), in other words, a real story. 

- **Love** (...by love...love is holy, revered, admired, praised, desired)

- **Way** relates to the concept of a *track*, *road*, *path*, *course*, *conduct*, *area* or *direction*, often shaped by repeated movement. A track forms in the ground from frequent foot traffic (treads) or dragged objects (treks). This relates to the concept of *road*, which word derived from the riding of animals (sitting on them to travel, being carried), especially on horses, likened to the movement, motion and stirring of water, especially boiling water, (relating also to a confused fight or quarrel, and to water springing up). This less directly relates to a river (a rip in the earth) and sea inlets (an entryway into the sea). The word *tread* relates to trade and trade routes.

- **Life** relates to concepts of having life, remaining alive, preserving life, sustaining life, being alive, to having a body, to exist, to remain, to dwell, to stay, to reside, to inhabit, to stick (glue).

- **True** relates to the word *tree* in the sense that a tree is not easily moved, compared to a stone boundary marker for instance. It also strongly relates to a tree generally having the attributes of being upright, straight, vertical, and reliable in nature, especially evidenced when building structures a strong and upright post or wall are said to be 'true' and 'supporting'. The etymology of 'true' also points to meanings like 'standing', 'durable', 'faithful' and 'trustworthy'. Less directly the etymology touches concepts of 'friend' and 'witness' (evidenced by trees and standing stones as witnesses or 'eyes' to agreements and boundaries) and as a cover/covering. Possibly also relates to *health* in the sense of wishing someone to be as healthy (strong) as a tree, and also related to trees (and plants) bringing healing (and illness if misused). In short: reliable, faithful and trustworthy.

- **False** (to falsify) relates to the idea of *deceiving* someone, and the word *fall(s)* with the idea of causing someone to *stumble* by your *lie* (from the idea that they *lie* down unintentionally after stumbling), thus the extended concepts of a fallen body and association with death. Thus True and False are technically at right angles to one another, not opposites per se.

- **Kill** relates to the idea of *striking* (like a snake) or *hitting* or *throwing* or *knocking down* (all like an ox) (thus causing to no longer stand upright but to fall and *lie* down permanently; incapacitated; unable to bear *life*; an irreversable lie).

- **Murder** unlawful or illegal killing, especially of a human.

- **Hope** as a concept means 'confident expectation' and relates to the idea of respectful acknowledgement of one's duties and obligations, especially as owed to someone greater than you, prostrating one's self to show this service.

## First words
*For most children the first word they learn is relational, either to mother or father*

- **Ma** - mother in many languages has an inward sucking type of sound.
- **Pa** - father in many languages has an outward plosive type of sound.

## An exploration of the roots of English

*One of the reasons that people find it difficult to learn English as a second language is that it is a blend of various other languages, which have each brought their own rules and grammar to the language. Many English words and grammar can be traced back to the Indo-European language family, a vast language group that includes languages as diverse as English, Sanskrit, Greek, Russian, German, Dutch, Swedish, and Icelandic.*

### A timeline of the English Language

Period|Key Events|Linguistic Influences|Notes
------|----------|---------------------|-----
Proto-Indo-European (Before 4500 BC)|Hypothetical ancestral language||Little is known of Mesolithic and Neolithic era migrations and trade routes.
Celtic Britain (500 BC - 43 AD)|Celtic tribes inhabit Britain|Celtic languages|The Celts had trade routes all across Europe. The Celtic languages are Irish Gaelic, Scottish Gaelic (Scotland), Manx (Isle of Man), Welsh (Wales), Cornish (Cornwall), Breton (Brittany in France), Gaulish (France, extinct), Lepontic (northern Italy, extinct) and Celtiberian (Spain and Portugal, extinct).
Roman Britain (43 - 410)|Roman conquest and occupation|Latin|Roman empire grew from Rome in modern italy, partly influenced by Celtic, Etruscan and Greek cultures. Rome was trading with southern England well before the 43 AD invasion.
Anglo-Saxon England (450 - 1066)|Anglo-Saxon migration and settlement|Old English dialects|Anglo-Saxon comes from three neighbouring tribes: Jutes (northern), Angels (central) and Saxons (southern). The Jutes from Jutland in Denmark, settled in Kent and south-east England. The Angles from Angeln, in northern Germany, settled in Anglia in north-east England. The Saxons of Saxony, in northern Germany, settled in south and central England.
Norse Invasions (787 - 1066)|Viking raids and settlements|Old Norse|Old Norse had several dialects, including Old Icelandic, Old Norwegian, and Old Danish
Norman Conquest (1066)|Norman invasion of England|Old French|Everyday Latin of Roman Empire → Roman invasion of Gaul (France) → Old French
Middle English (1066 - 1500)|Linguistic blending and standardization|French, Latin, Greek, and other languages|Middle English was a crucial period in the development of modern English, as it marked the blending of Old English, Old French, and other languages, leading to the formation of a more standardized and flexible language.
Early Modern English (1500 - 1700)|Renaissance, Age of Exploration|Latin, Greek, and languages from colonized territories|Printed material became more widespread. The 'great vowel shift' occurred in this period where so-called 'educated' people changed the way they spoke. For example, the word "house" was pronounced as "hoos" in Middle English, but it now has the pronunciation "howz." This has changed how Modern English is spoken generally.
Modern English (1700 - Present)|Globalization, technological advancements|Diverse languages from around the world|English has become a global language, influenced by various cultures and languages.
