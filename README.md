### Quotes

> A movie is never really finished, just released. - Bonnie Arnold, a producer of the 'How to Train Your Dragon' movies.

> If you're not embarassed by your early work, you spent too long on it. - Attributed to Neil Gaiman

> Where possible, focus on things that are worthwhile. - Andrew Kingdom

> Writer's Block? Think about things differently by: Adding a new communication; add in random text from any source at hand; take time to relax, help a stranger, rewrite in a different format (e.g. story as a screenplay), don't get bogged down, put down the basics and move on. -- Andrew Kingdom

> Even experts know less than 1% of everything that can be known about life, the universe and everything. To think otherwise is to not even be aware of your own ignorance.  — Andrew Kingdom

> Being an expert in one field does not guarantee expertise in another field. For example, understanding the science of combustion doesn't automatically make me good at cooking food on a fire. — Andrew Kingdom

> No work is ever worth a divorce  — Andrew Kingdom

> You can't truly love others if you're not caring for yourself. It's like how airlines say, 'Put on your own mask first, then help others.'  — Andrew Kingdom

> Intelligence has little to do with a person's value as a human. — Andrew Kingdom

> A.I. is a tool made by humans to assist humans; don't confuse it with actual intelligence, the two are not the same and will never be so. — Andrew Kingdom

> Un-deception is the successful resolution of misapprehension, that is, the changing of your mind concerning a misbelief. This is not the same as trying to change someone else's mind. — A. Kingdom on C.S. Lewis on J. Austen

> I.Q. tests are intended as a measure of a person's mental ability to solve certain problems within a very narrow mindset and domain knowledge, which generally excludes: a person's full intellect, emotional quotient, physical intellect, spatial intellect, spiritual intellect, love, kindness, ethics, mental alertness and many other factors. In my experience the tests often assume a single correct answer, whereas in reality there are often many ways to answer the question, depending how you consider it. — Andrew Kingdom

> The Role of Emotional Context in Effective Decision-Making and Communication:
> - **Understanding context** when making informed decisions enhances relationships and communication (acknowledging emotions is part of the context).
> - **Managing emotions in the bigger picture** improves decision-making and reduces excessive conflict, leading to clearer perspectives and rational choices.
> - **Communicating decisions clearly** positively impacts circumstances and strengthens emotional well-being.
— Andrew Kingdom
